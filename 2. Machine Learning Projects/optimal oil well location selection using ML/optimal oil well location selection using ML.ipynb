Initial data cleaning ensures data integrity, while linear regression models predict oil reserve volumes for each region. Key profitability parameters are meticulously defined for accurate evaluation, encompassing revenue per barrel, development budget, and the minimum reserves for a viable well. Model accuracy is rigorously assessed through metrics like average predicted reserves and root mean square error. The incorporation of bootstrapping techniques enables a granular analysis of risks and profits, providing insights through average profit, 95% confidence intervals, and loss probability. Visualization tools, such as histograms, enhance the clarity of profit distributions. This approach enables us to offer precise recommendations on the most economically sound regions for oil well development, facilitating strategic decision-making in the oil extraction sector."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RGRobYmdbliN","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# import required libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as
