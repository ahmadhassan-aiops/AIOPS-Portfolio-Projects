identifying areas where financial institutions can improve their services. Effectively categorizing these complaints into specific product categories, such as credit reports, student loans, or money transfers, is essential for addressing customer concerns promptly by routing the tickets to relevant personnel. Leveraging Generative AI for text classification can help financial institutions better understand customer grievances and respond more efficiently. Apart from this, a summary of the customer complaint helps the support personnel quickly grasp the gist of the grievance*\n","\n","### **Objective**\n","*The primary goal of this project is to utilize Generative AI techniques to improve the classification and summarization of customer complaints in the financial sector.\n","Specifically, the project will focus on:*\n","\n","1. **Text-to-Label Classification:** *Implementing Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting methods to accurately classify customer complaints into relevant product categories.*\n","2. **Text-to-Text Summarization:** *Using Zero-shot prompting to generate concise summaries of customer complaints, enabling more personalized and effective responses.*\n","\n","### **Conclusion**\n","*Upon completing this project, you will have the capability to develop end-to-end applications for LLM-based text classification and summarization. These tools will enable financial institutions to automate the complaint handling process, leading to faster, more accurate responses to customer issues, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced compliance with industry regulations. This project will also provide you with valuable skills and experience that can be applied to a range of real-world business challenges.*\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hJfHP45hZpwW","tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Section 1 : Setting Up for Prompt Engineering with Mistral Model**"],"metadata":{"id":"na6DoDeQBIbn","tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Install & Importing neccessary libraries**"],"metadata":{"id":"XcGMygn3_Mq9","tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!apt-get update\n","!apt-get install -y ninja-build cmake\n","!pip install ipywidgets --upgrade"],"metadata":{"id":"k55ATwppBVZj","tags":[],"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-22T20:18:32.687877Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-22T20:18:32.688139Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-22T20:18:47.188503Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-22T20:18:32.688114Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-22T20:18:47.187473Z"},"outputId":"f2bb7430-fb9f-4f0e-e21f-51bf02e96ace"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Get:1 https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/ InRelease [3,626 B]\nGet:2 https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64  InRelease [1,581 B]\nHit:3 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy InRelease                                              \nGet:4 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates InRelease [128 kB]                             \nGet:5 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security InRelease [129 kB]                           \nGet:6 https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/ Packages [62.5 kB]                 \nGet:7 https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy InRelease [6,555 B]                                \nGet:8 https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64  Packages [1,234 kB]\nGet:9 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-backports InRelease [127 kB]                           \nGet:10 https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy/main all Packages [8,619 kB]                      \nGet:11 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease [18.1 kB]   \nGet:12 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/restricted amd64 Packages [3,663 kB]          \nGet:13 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease [24.3 kB]\nHit:14 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/ubuntugis/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease                        \nGet:15 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/multiverse amd64 Packages [45.2 kB]         \nGet:16 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/universe amd64 Packages [1,519 kB]            \nGet:17 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/main amd64 Packages [2,860 kB]                \nGet:18 https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy/main amd64 Packages [2,646 kB]                    \nGet:19 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-backports/universe amd64 Packages [35.2 kB]           \nGet:20 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/main amd64 Packages [2,561 kB]              \nGet:21 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu jammy/main amd64 Packages [32.9 kB]   \nGet:22 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu jammy/main amd64 Packages [53.6 kB]\nGet:23 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/restricted amd64 Packages [3,527 kB]  \nGet:24 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/universe amd64 Packages [1,228 kB]\nFetched 28.5 MB in 3s (11.0 MB/s)                            \nReading package lists...

which describes the reasoning behind the model's classification. However, this explanation often leads to a mismatch between the actual class in the product variable and the extracted class in mistral_response, making it difficult for the model to compute an accurate F1 score. To address this, the mistral_response was cleaned by removing all text except the initial label, which corresponds to the class the model is supposed to predict. After cleaning, the F1 score improved significantly, as the extracted class now better aligns with the product category. For instance, a complaint related to credit reporting was initially classified with additional explanation, resulting in a mismatch and an F1 score of 0.

This suggests that the task of classifying customer complaints into predefined categories is relatively simple, and the model's pre-trained knowledge is sufficient to handle it without the need for additional examples. While few-shot prompting could potentially improve performance by providing specific examples, the difference in F1 scores is minimal, indicating that zero-shot prompting performs just as well for this straightforward classification task.
