#Summary of Project

The project aimed to analyze usage data for a specific period, with a focus on understanding the significant drop in usage observed in January 2023 for selected customers. The analysis involved several key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - The usage data was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Necessary data transformations were performed, such as converting the 'Date' column to datetime format and extracting the year from the dates.

2. **Usage Trend Analysis:**
   - The total usage over the years was visualized to identify any trends or patterns in usage over time.

3. **Identification of Significant Drop Customers:**
   - Customers who experienced a significant drop in usage in January 2023 compared to their average usage in previous years were identified.
   - This was determined based on a criterion where the average usage in previous years was more than 50% higher than the usage in January 2023.

4. **Feature Analysis:**
   - The usage of different features was analyzed to understand their involvement in the observed decline in usage.
   - The average usage of features in January 2023 was calculated, providing insights into feature popularity and usage patterns.

5. **Usage Comparison for Selected Customers:**
   - The average usage of selected customers in previous years was compared with their usage in January 2023.
   - This comparison helped in understanding individual customer behaviors and identifying potential reasons for the decline in usage.

6. **Findings:**
   - The analysis revealed specific features that were more heavily used in January 2023, providing insights into user preferences and priorities.
   - Selected customers were identified who experienced a notable decrease in usage in January 2023 compared to previous years. This allowed for targeted investigation into the factors contributing to the decline.
